  "After months without any success, I was fortunate to discover Encore Bridal's ad and contacted the owner, Julie. Her professional and prompt responses to my many questions put my fears to rest about sending such a valuable dress to someone I had never met. Encore's excellent marketing of my daughter's dress resulted in it being sold within two months. <strong>I would highly recommend Julie and Encore Bridal to anyone</strong> hoping to sell, or get a great deal on, a new or nearly new wedding gown." â€”Review by Lynn L. on Wedding Wire
